# Discord Example Selfbot
Shitty code base for Discord selfbot (USE AT YOUR OWN RISK)

## Usage
- Clone or download this repository
- `cd` into the newly downloaded / cloned repository.
- Run `npm i` to install the required packages to run this selfbot.
- Once all required packages are installed, fill in the config.json with your user token. If you don't know how to get your user token, use google instead of spam DMing me :).
- Run the bot using `npm run dev` in the root folder or `node src/index.js` if you don't want nodemon automatically restarting your bot.
- Contact me on Discord (Cypphi#7860) if you still have any issues. I'll only reply to people who did the above steps correctly.
